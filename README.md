## Technology Stack

| Technology     | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python**     | The primary programming language used for building the backend logic.  |
| **Django**     | A high-level Python web framework used to build a robust and scalable backend. It simplifies development with built-in tools for authentication, ORM, and routing. |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | An extension of Django that makes it easy to build RESTful APIs for the application. It provides serialization, authentication, and permissions out-of-the-box. |
| **PostgreSQL** | A powerful open-source relational database used to store and manage application data like users, listings, bookings, and payments. |
| **GraphQL** *(if applicable)* | An alternative to REST APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Useful for optimizing data queries in complex systems. |
| **Stripe / PayPal** | Used for integrating secure online payment processing to handle user transactions. |
| **Docker**     | Used to containerize the application for easier deployment and environment consistency. |
| **Git & GitHub** | Version control and collaboration tools for managing codebase changes and team contributions. |
| **Render / Heroku** | Cloud platforms used for deploying and hosting the backend application. |

## Database Design

### 1. **User**
Represents guests and hosts using the platform.

**Important Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Used for login and notifications
- `password`: Hashed password for authentication
- `is_host`: Boolean to identify if the user can list properties

---

### 2. **Property**
Represents a listing created by a host.

**Important Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Name of the property
- `description`: Detailed info about the listing
- `location`: Address or city of the property
- `price_per_night`: Cost to rent per night

**Relationship:**  
- A **User** (host) can have **many Properties**  
- Each **Property** belongs to **one User**

---

### 3. **Booking**
Tracks when and how long a guest books a property.

**Important Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Reference to the booking user (guest)
- `property_id`: Reference to the booked property
- `check_in`: Start date
- `check_out`: End date

**Relationship:**  
- A **User** can have **many Bookings**  
- A **Property** can have **many Bookings**  
- Each **Booking** is tied to **one User** and **one Property**

---

### 4. **Review**
Allows users to rate and comment on properties.

**Important Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Reviewer‚Äôs ID
- `property_id`: Reviewed property
- `rating`: Score (e.g., 1‚Äì5)
- `comment`: Text feedback

**Relationship:**  
- A **User** can write **multiple Reviews**  
- A **Property** can have **multiple Reviews**  
- Each **Review** belongs to **one User** and **one Property**

---

### 5. **Payment**
Records details of completed transactions.

**Important Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Linked booking
- `amount`: Total cost paid
- `payment_method`: e.g., card, PayPal
- `status`: e.g., completed, failed

**Relationship:**  
- Each **Payment** is associated with **one Booking**  
- Each **Booking** can have **one Payment**
This structure clearly defines each entity and how they relate. Would you like a visual ER diagram version of this too?

## API Security

Security is critical in any application that handles sensitive user data, financial transactions, and user-generated content. Below are the key security practices and why they matter:

### 1. **Authentication**
- **What:** Secure login and registration using hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt) and token-based authentication (JWT or Django's session-based auth).
- **Why:** Ensures that only verified users can access their accounts and prevents unauthorized access.

### 2. **Authorization**
- **What:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to determine what actions users (e.g., guests vs. hosts) can perform.
- **Why:** Prevents users from performing actions beyond their permission level (e.g., a guest modifying another host‚Äôs property).

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
- **What:** Limits the number of API requests from a user/IP in a given time frame.
- **Why:** Mitigates brute-force attacks and protects against denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

### 4. **Data Validation & Sanitization**
- **What:** Validates user input on both frontend and backend; sanitizes inputs to avoid injection attacks.
- **Why:** Prevents SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and other common web vulnerabilities.

### 5. **Secure Payment Integration**
- **What:** Use third-party providers (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to handle all payment data.
- **Why:** Keeps sensitive financial information out of the application and ensures PCI compliance.

### 6. **HTTPS & SSL**
- **What:** Enforce HTTPS to encrypt data in transit between the client and server.
- **Why:** Prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

### 7. **Database Access Control**
- **What:** Restrict database access using environment variables and roles/permissions.
- **Why:** Prevents unauthorized data exposure or manipulation.

### 8. **Logging & Monitoring**
- **What:** Log important events and monitor system activity (e.g., login attempts, payment failures).
- **Why:** Helps in detecting suspicious behavior and improving incident response.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Briefly explain what CI/CD pipelines are and why they are important for the project.

Mention the tools that could be used for this (e.g., GitHub Actions, Docker, etc.).
